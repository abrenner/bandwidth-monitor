Bandwidth Monitor
=================

A perl and PHP based bandwidth monitor (with graphs) for unix based machines. Uses ifconfig to track eth0 readings and plots them on a graph using RRDtool.

Wanted to learn perl, some graph tools and never ran PHP as a CLI script, so I figured why not. Not the most efficient, but it does work.
